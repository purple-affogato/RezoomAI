## Inspiration

Many CS students around the world apply for hundreds of jobs just to land one job interview. One common tip we've heard is that you should tailor your resume for each application based on the job's description. But this can be a timely task, especially if you're applying to hundreds of job postings. RezoomAI aims to fix this issue by automating the process of resume customization using AI.

## What it does
 Our project aims to speed up (zoom!) the application process by using AI and LLMs to generate custom resumes for each job that you apply for. Firstly, the user enters in their information, such as education, experience, and skills. Secondly, we use a LLM to make their resume descriptions ATS-friendly (passes resume scanning software easily). When the user needs to apply to a job, they are prompted to input a job description that we use to prompt a LLM to create a tailor-made resume.

## How we built it
Firstly, we built the frontend using React and Bootstrap.
